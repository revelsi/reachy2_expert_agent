    "# Tutorial nÂ°1 - SDK : Reachy's awakening\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how do a task with Reachy using the SDK client. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to make Reachy do the awake sequence, which is a series of movements that makes it look like it is waking up. It involves moving its head and arms and can be used as a starting point for more complex sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will learn:\n",
    "- How to make it move its head\n",
    "- How to make it move its arms\n",
    "- How to synchronize head and arms movements\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the SDK client, you first need to install *reachy2-sdk*. If it is not the case, checkout the section below ðŸ‘‡\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<summary>Install the Python library reachy2-sdk</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you'd better **work in a virtual environment**. You have 2 different ways to install the sdk : \n",
    "- by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "pip install reachy2-sdk -e .\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- from source by following the instructions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used the SDK client before, don't forget to do the [Getting Started notebooks](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-sdk/tree/develop/src/examples), that will help you understand all the basics you need to know about it ! And if you want to go further, you can also check the [SDK documentation](https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Material\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you'll only need Reachy and that's it ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, before making the real robot move, working on a **virtual Reachy is strongly recommended** to visualize the movements and try to modify them. For that, you can follow the documentation [ajout du lien] and instanciate a ReachySDK with the *IP = 'localhost'*. Once you're sure that all your moves are safe for the robot, you can work on the real Reachy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Scene\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your Reachy must be at a sufficient **height** so that its outstretched arms do not touch the mobile base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put Reachy in a safe environment with enough place to move around, no one in reachable space and no obstacles (as there are no safety yet preventing the robot from colliding with its environment). And always keep the emergency stop button nearby! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build step by step the program that will enable Reachy to look like it's awakening. Here, you can have a look at what Reachy will do at the end :\n",

    "- head movements\n",
    "- arms movements\n",
    "- synchronization between Reachy's parts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now use this sequence as a starting point to create other complex behaviors on the robot. Feel free to modify the movements, the duration of the movements, the order of the movements, etc. to get more familiar with the SDK, the robot and to check whether you can make Reachy do what you want it to do ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general tips to keep in mind to be the best at implementing complex behaviors on Reachy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always test behavior** on a fake robot before running it on the real robot! This will help you check if the behavior is doing what you expect it to do and to avoid any potential damage to the robot.\n",
    "- If you are working on the real robot, make sure that it has enough space around it to move its arms and head. Especially, make sure that the arms will not be blocked by objects such as a table as there are no safety yet preventing the robot for colliding with its environment.\n",
    "- Split the behavior you wish to develop into smaller parts and implement them one by one. Once each part is working, you can combine them to create the full sequence. Go slow and test each part before moving on to the next one. \n",
    "\n",

    "Here, we've covered just a few of the methods that can be used on Reachy. To discover more ways of controlling the robot, don't hesitate to continue following the tutorials ! \n",
