    "Here is where things get interesting. If we use `arm.translate_by()` or `arm.goto()`, we have no guarantee that the arms won't collide together performing their respective moves (spoiler alert : they will). \n",

    "So we want the right arm to go back the extended position by following a trajectory that will avoid the left arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we can use the feature that interpolates trajectory tracking: `send_cartesian_interpolation()` \n",
    "By default, it's a linear interpolation, but if you set the parameter 'arc_direction', you can follow a semi-circular trajectory until the target position. \n",
    "With the *arc_direction* parameter set to \"right\", the semi circle trajectory will be in the `(x, y)` plane, going to the right.\n",
