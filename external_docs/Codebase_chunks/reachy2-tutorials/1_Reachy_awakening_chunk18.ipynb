    "> ðŸ’¡ Note that we don't wait for the end of the movements of the moving arm in this function as we want the head to follow the effector while the arm is moving. We only wait for the end of the last movement to consider the whole sequence done. While the arm is moving, we call the forward_kinematics method of the arm to get the coordinates of the effector and make the head look at this point.\n",
