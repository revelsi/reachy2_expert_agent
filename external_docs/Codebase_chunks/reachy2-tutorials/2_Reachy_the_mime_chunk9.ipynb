    "> ðŸ’¡ One important thing to notice is the gripper frames. You can see that they are oriented the same way as the torso when the arms are in the **default** position, meaning along the body. Now look at what happens when we set the arms at 90Â° : forward is `-z`, right is `-y` and up is `+x`. This can be a little counter intuitive when computing poses in the gripper's reference frame, so keep that in mind!"
