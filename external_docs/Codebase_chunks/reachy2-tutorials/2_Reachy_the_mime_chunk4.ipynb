    "First, we will connect to the robot. To do so, we need to import the SDK client package and to instanciate a ReachySDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two requirements :\n",
    "- Your computer needs to be on the same network as the robot.\n",
    "- You need to know your Reachy's IP : to do so, you have two options : \n",
    "    - you can check it on the dashboard (*.local_IP_address_of_your_robot:8000* in a browser), section Network. \n",
    "    - you can have a look at the small screen on Reachy's back, that will show you one at a time its Ethernet and its Wifi IP. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ’¡ You'll see that it's really easy to mistakenly run on the real robot before testing in simulation. So you can add a security on your code : if you put the IP of a real robot, the program will ask you a confirmation by pressing \"y\" or \"yes\" before executing anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's connect to it."
