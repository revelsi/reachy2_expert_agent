    "- synchronization between Reachy's parts\n",
    "- grasping movements\n",
    "- combination of perception and movement\n",

    "You can now use this sequence as a starting point to create other complex behaviors on the robot. Feel free to modify the movements, the duration of the movements, the order of the movements, etc. to get more familiar with the SDK, the robot and to check whether you can make Reachy do what you want it to do ! \n",

    "Here are some general tips to keep in mind to be the best at implementing complex behaviors on Reachy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always test behavior** on a fake robot before running it on the real robot! This will help you check if the behavior is doing what you expect it to do and to avoid any potential damage to the robot.\n",
    "- If you are working on the real robot, make sure that it has enough space around it to move its arms and head, and **always** have the emergency shutdown nearby. Especially, make sure that the arms will not be blocked by objects such as a table as there are no safety yet preventing the robot for colliding with its environment.\n",
