Be careful, the reference frame doesn't update, unless you call yourself the function *reachy.mobile.reset_odometry()*. That means that if you want to move again 0.2m forward after the first move, you will have to set the command with x = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4m. So, to be sure the reference frame is well set, we can call the reset_odometry before sending the command. \n",
