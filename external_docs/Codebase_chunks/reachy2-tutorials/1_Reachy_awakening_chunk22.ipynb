    "Now, you've learned how to build a sequence on Reachy using only the SDK Client with: \n",
    "- head movements\n",
    "- arms movements\n",
    "- synchronization between Reachy's parts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now use this sequence as a starting point to create other complex behaviors on the robot. Feel free to modify the movements, the duration of the movements, the order of the movements, etc. to get more familiar with the SDK, the robot and to check whether you can make Reachy do what you want it to do ! \n",

    "Here are some general tips to keep in mind to be the best at implementing complex behaviors on Reachy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always test behavior** on a fake robot before running it on the real robot! This will help you check if the behavior is doing what you expect it to do and to avoid any potential damage to the robot.\n",
    "- If you are working on the real robot, make sure that it has enough space around it to move its arms and head. Especially, make sure that the arms will not be blocked by objects such as a table as there are no safety yet preventing the robot for colliding with its environment.\n",
    "- Split the behavior you wish to develop into smaller parts and implement them one by one. Once each part is working, you can combine them to create the full sequence. Go slow and test each part before moving on to the next one. \n",
