    "Generally speaking, before making the real robot move, working on a **virtual Reachy is strongly recommended** to visualize the movements and try to modify them. For that, you can follow the documentation [ajout du lien] and instanciate a ReachySDK with the *IP = 'localhost'*. Once you're sure that all your moves are safe for the robot, you can work on the real Reachy. \n",
    "Just know that for this tutorial, you won't be able to test it entirerely on the fake robot, as the mobile base is not set on virtual Reachy. \n",
