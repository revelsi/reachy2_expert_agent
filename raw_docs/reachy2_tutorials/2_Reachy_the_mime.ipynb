    "# Tutorial nÂ°2 - SDK : Reachy the mime\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to do a more complex task with Reachy using the SDK client, with both arms and the mobile base, all moving together at the same time !\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to transform Reachy into a mime who pulls an invisible rope. \n",
    "\n",
    "What you will learn : \n",
    "\n",
    "- How to use the mobile base,\n",
    "- How to synchronize arms and mobile base movements,\n",
    "- How and when to use blocking gotos,\n",
    "- How to follow a trajectory with the end effector.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the SDK client, you first need to install *reachy2-sdk*. If it is not the case, checkout the section below ðŸ‘‡\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<summary>Install the Python library reachy2-sdk</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you'd better **work in a virtual environment**. You have 2 different ways to install the sdk : \n",
    "- by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "pip install reachy2-sdk -e .\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "- from source by following the instructions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-sdk)\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never used the SDK client before, don't forget to do the [Getting Started notebooks](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-sdk/tree/develop/src/examples), that will help you understand all the basics you need to know about it ! And if you want to go further, you can also check the [SDK documentation](https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Material\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, you'll only need Reachy, and that's it ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, before making the real robot move, working on a **virtual Reachy is strongly recommended** to visualize the movements and try to modify them. For that, you can follow the documentation [ajout du lien] and instanciate a ReachySDK with the *IP = 'localhost'*. Once you're sure that all your moves are safe for the robot, you can work on the real Reachy. \n",
    "Just know that for this tutorial, you won't be able to test it entirerely on the fake robot, as the mobile base is not set on virtual Reachy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Scene\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your Reachy must be at a sufficient **height** so that its outstretched arms do not touch the mobile base. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put Reachy in a safe environment with enough place to move around, no one in reachable space and no obstacles (as there are no safety yet preventing the robot from colliding with its environment). And always keep the emergency stop button nearby! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build step by step the program that will enable Reachy to pull a rope. Here, you can have a look at what Reachy will do at the end :\n",

    "\n",
    "Two requirements :\n",
    "- Your computer needs to be on the same network as the robot.\n",
    "- You need to know your Reachy's IP : to do so, you have two options : \n",

    "\n",
    "> ðŸ’¡ You'll see that it's really easy to mistakenly run on the real robot before testing in simulation. So you can add a security on your code : if you put the IP of a real robot, the program will ask you a confirmation by pressing \"y\" or \"yes\" before executing anything. \n",

    "- synchronization between Reachy's parts\n",

Feel free to modify the movements, the duration of the movements, the order of the movements, etc. to get more familiar with the SDK, the robot and to check whether you can make Reachy do what you want it to do ! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some general tips to keep in mind to be the best at implementing complex behaviors on Reachy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always test behavior** on a fake robot before running it on the real robot! This will help you check if the behavior is doing what you expect it to do and to avoid any potential damage to the robot.\n",
    "- If you are working on the real robot, make sure that it has enough space around it to move its arms and head, and **always** have the emergency shutdown nearby. Especially, make sure that the arms will not be blocked by objects such as a table as there are no safety yet preventing the robot for colliding with its environment.\n",
    "- Split the behavior you wish to develop into smaller parts and implement them one by one. Once each part is working, you can combine them to create the full sequence. Go slow and test each part before moving on to the next one. \n",
