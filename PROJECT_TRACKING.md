## Known Issues
1. nDCG scores need improvement for API documentation
2. Some semantic matches could be more precise
3. Need to handle edge cases in chunking

## Next Steps
1. Implement re-ranking system
2. Enhance evaluation metrics
3. Add more comprehensive test cases
4. Optimize retrieval performance
