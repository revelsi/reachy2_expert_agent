Progress Summary:

1. Updated the scraping script (scripts/scrape_api_docs.py) to remove unwanted elements:
   - Removed labels and anchors with 'view source'.
   - Additionally removed any elements with the class 'pdoc-code codehilite'.

2. Modified the script to treat each <div> within a section as a separate chunk, prepending any <h1> header if available.

3. Extended the functionality to scrape two URLs:
   - https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk/reachy_sdk.html
   - https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html
   Each Document object is tagged with the source URL prefixed with '@'.
