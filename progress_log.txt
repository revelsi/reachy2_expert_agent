Progress Summary:

1. Updated the scraping script (scripts/scrape_api_docs.py) to remove unwanted elements:
   - Removed labels and anchors with 'view source'.
   - Additionally removed any elements with the class 'pdoc-code codehilite'.

2. Modified the script to treat each <div> within a section as a separate chunk, prepending any <h1> header if available.

3. Extended the functionality to scrape two URLs:
   - https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk/reachy_sdk.html
   - https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy2-sdk/reachy2_sdk.html
   Each Document object is tagged with the source URL prefixed with '@'.

Next Step:
Begin a new task. Please let me know the details of the new task, or further adjustments you'd like to make.

2024-01-17: Major refactoring of document processing pipeline
- Created utils/ package with specialized modules:
  * code_utils.py: AST-based parsing of Python files into meaningful chunks
  * notebook_utils.py: Proper notebook cell extraction with context
  * doc_utils.py: Common document handling utilities
- Improved chunking strategy:
  * Removed basic text-based chunking in favor of semantic chunking
  * Code files now split by functions/classes with preserved docstrings
  * Notebooks split by cells with proper section tracking
  * API docs maintain their natural document structure
- Cleaned up project structure:
  * Removed redundant Pollen Vision scraper
  * Added clean target to Makefile for fresh starts
  * Organized utilities into proper Python package
- Output is now standardized:
  * All documents use LangChain Document format
  * Rich metadata for better context
  * JSON storage in external_docs/Codebase/ 

Progress Log - Updated on 2023-10-05

- Standardized on all-roberta-large-v1 (RoBERTa) as the default embedding model.
- Updated utils/embedding_utils.py to include a ChromaEmbeddingFunction wrapper for compatibility with ChromaDB.
- Fixed metadata cleaning in embedding_utils to ensure JSON-serializability and ChromaDB compatibility (e.g., converting None to empty string).
- Revised utils/db_utils.py to improve VectorStore operations:
   - Added cleanup functionality to remove old collections and temporary directories.
   - Implemented get_collection_with_dimension_check to handle dimension mismatches.
   - Ensured proper document deduplication when adding documents.
- Refactored scripts/update_vectordb.py to simplify the process of updating the vector store with JSON documents.
- Revamped scripts/evaluate_retrieval.py:
   - Simplified test queries with updated relevance judgments based on document content.
   - Improved metric calculations (precision, recall, MRR, nDCG).
- Overall, the retrieval pipeline is now cleaner, more robust, and yields meaningful evaluation metrics.

Future Improvements:
- Further tuning of relevance matching criteria for evaluation.
- Additional logging for deeper diagnostics.
